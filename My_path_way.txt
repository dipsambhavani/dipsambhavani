This is how i am going to learn DSA.

At first I have registered on 11 week workshop of GEEKSFORGEEKS.
And now as I am excited about some cool work and coding so with some guidance I am starting with the array from learning part of the workshop

At the first part we are going with defination as obvious.
So the array is the set of some variables of same datatype in a chain

To define an array in cpp is so simple
We just need to follow this Syntax given below
Datatype arrayname[sizeofthearray];
Where datatype can be any datatype 
We can give any name to array according to the naming of variables in cpp
We can mention size of array and if we'll not it will adjust the size as per further use of that array

To assign the value or values to the array
We will follow some of the methods like
The first and very simple method is to assign value while defining or declaration of the array
Datatype arrayname[size] = { value1, value2, value3,....};
Another method is to assign value while main part of the program or after defining at any part of the code.
Here is how we do that
Arrayname = { value1, value2, value3,....};
Or we can assign value to a specific index of array
Arrayname[I] = value;
Where I is the index of the array
And we can do that also like this way
Arrayname[i:j] = { value1, value2, value(j-i)};

After assigning the values we have to access those also
So to access this values we will use the same way as we were assigning the values in our last method
So we will treat each element of the array as a seprate variable which hase name as the name of the array but with its index behind it in [] breakers
Like if we can print the 6th element of an array this way
printf("%d", array[5]);

Now we have learned how to find the specific element in an array
So it will go like this
We will loop the array for that many times as many as the number of elements do we have in our array
And each time we will check all the elements using the condition as if it's same to the element we are searching for or not
So the code will be like this
For(i=0; i<n; i++){
    if(i == value){
        printf("we find it on %d", i);
    }
    Else{
        printf("its not on %d", i);
    }
}
